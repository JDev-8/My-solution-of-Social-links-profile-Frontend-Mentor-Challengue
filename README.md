# Social links profile

I want to share my experience with the recent Frontend Mentor challenge: creating a card with links to social networks. It has been a very enriching project! Through this challenge, I have been able to consolidate my knowledge about HTML properties and tags. Creating a card with a minimalist design has allowed me to experiment with different styles and approaches.Furthermore, the implementation of responsive design is very important to be at the forefront. Also, I ventured into using pseudoclasses and transitions. Although it was a little overwhelming at first, curiosity led me to explore these features and the result was amazing. I am very satisfied with the final result! The card meets the challenge requirements I thank Frontend Mentor for coming up with such interesting and useful challenges. I will continue exploring and learning to become a better frontend developer!
